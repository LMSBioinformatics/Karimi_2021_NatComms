# ScRNAseq-SMARTer-Analysis
This repository contains scripts used in the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data generated using Smart-seq2 and SMARTer protocols from mouse thymocytes.


### Alignment

Smart-seq2 and SMARTer sequencing data were aligned with TopHat2 version 2.1.1 (Kim et al., 2013). GRCm38 (mm10) mouse genome reference was used for alignment and gene annotation from UCSC.

### Quantification

Read counts for genes were calculated using velocyto version 0.17 (La Manno et al., 2018) and the cell-gene count matrix obtained was used for downstream analysis.
